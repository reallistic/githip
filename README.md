# githip
Git hip to the popularity of your organization's project on github


# About
GitHip will show you the popularity of your organizations githib projects based on the *open source index* or OSI for short.
The OSI is determined by *the ratio of commits from non-organization members vs organization members multiplied by the average number of commits per week*.

The idea is that repositories with a higher non-member/member commit ratio and a lot of activity will be more popular.
This project will test that assumption.
